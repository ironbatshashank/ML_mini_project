(i) Formulate a machine learning problem that can be attempted using the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset and build a solution model. (ii) Create a product that uses the functionality provided by a model trained on the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset (e.g. a simple App that predicts the label Harry or StarWars when you hum to it).  \n",
